# A Message About Code Theft and Respect for My Work + How to run it

Hey everyone,

I want to take a moment to address something important regarding my project, Nebula OS. As a new coder, this project means a lot to me, and I'm learning and growing with each line of code I write. It‚Äôs been an exciting journey, but I‚Äôm also doing my best to make sure that Nebula OS remains something original and truly my own.

I ask that you respect the work I‚Äôve put into this project and avoid taking or "stealing" code from it without permission. Copying code without giving credit isn‚Äôt just disrespectful‚Äîit also stifles my growth as a developer. I‚Äôm doing my best to learn, make improvements, and contribute to the open-source community in a positive way.

If you‚Äôre interested in using parts of Nebula OS for your own projects, I‚Äôd be more than happy to discuss it with you or share certain parts of the code if it‚Äôs appropriate! Just reach out and we can collaborate in a way that‚Äôs fair and supportive.

Finally, I want to ask for your understanding as I continue to develop my skills. I‚Äôm still learning, and I really appreciate your patience and support. Let‚Äôs build something great together, and let‚Äôs keep the spirit of coding open, respectful, and collaborative!

Thank you!
‚Äî Nebula
